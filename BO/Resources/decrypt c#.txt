 WHAT I NEEEDDDD TO DOOOOO is????? what ar eyou doing
// Iv table
        private static byte[] Table;
 
        // Lookup values
        private static int[] BlockNums;
 
public static void BuildTable(byte[] Feed)
        {
            // Init tables
            Table = new byte[4000];
            BlockNums = new int[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 };
 
            // Build table
            int ptr = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++)
            {
                for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++)
                {
                    // Check next byte
                    if (Feed[ptr] == 0x00)
                        ptr = 0;
 
                    // Copy 4 times
                    Table[(i * 20) + (x * 4)] = Feed[ptr];
                    Table[(i * 20) + (x * 4) + 1] = Feed[ptr];
                    Table[(i * 20) + (x * 4) + 2] = Feed[ptr];
                    Table[(i * 20) + (x * 4) + 3] = Feed[ptr];
                    ptr++;
                }
            }
        }
		where is that made? it literly injects it into each fast file u still here? ye this does not make any sense to me right now lol where is feed[ptr] being set?
		and where is ptr being set tbh i made this with a friend he did that part while i did the creating the table part dont you need both both what? his part and this
		ok if iloaded the entire file into memory
		how do you decrypt it
		like iwhats the process
		it basically injects the tables into the fast file along with the iv.... ur good friends with v2 right? yes i bet he will explain a bit more if ya ask him hes not gonna tell me
		how do i "inject" and do the iv shit
		how do i do it with this crap? ok so what do you know
		tha we have to work from
		i told ya what i know lol i sound like a complete retard right now inah so what should we do then ?i wanna make this happen
		but you need to give me more info that that
		or at least explain it in a way i get it
		alright i will try again
		so u know what the byte key does right/ no sir great.... lol i know its like the key
		tot he encryption i just dont know like where it comes into play how aboyt we ask him :)
